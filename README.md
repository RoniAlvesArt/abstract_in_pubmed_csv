# abstract_in_pubmed_csv
I noticed that when downloading a CSV file from the PubMed website, the abstracts are not included in the exported data. This script helps by automatically retrieving abstracts for each PMID (PubMed Identifier) and adding them as a new column in your CSV file. This script can solve the problem.
